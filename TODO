TODO LIST BY VIATHINKSOFT

	Make better automated test cases that check if CGI/CGIPOST requests were sucessful

	Problem: If you run the pattern update, you will most likely create a conflict when running the SVN update

	Installer: The package names are optimized for Debian. How to make it work for other distros?
	For the command "nc" you probably need different packages: netcat-traditional, netcat oder netcat-openbsd, netcat6 ?

	Look at all TODO entries in the source codes

	Build up test case system
	... test and rate all patterns automatically
	... there are partially problems with highlighting

	RIR bugreports

	Core: Insert "\n\n" after each output of www or other subprogram?

	Output errors in STDERR

	pattern-generator: if whois servers are changing, the pattern generator
	should automatically change the server in the pattern file, too (comment out the previous one)

	Are there more PHP packages which we need?

	reintroduce PO translations ? are the *.po files still up-to-date ? How to use PO ?

	reintroduce INETD service entry ?

	pattern version 20190521 should be 2019-05-21
