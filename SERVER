If you want to operate a whois proxy,
you can use the super server (X)InetD.


To add vgwhois to xinetd,
create /etc/xinetd.d/vgwhois with following contents:
	service whois
	{
	        socket_type     = stream
	        wait            = no
	        user            = root
	        server          = /usr/bin/vgwhois
	        disable         = no
	}


To add vgwhois to inetd (inetd is outdated though)
	update-inetd --add 'whois         stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /daten/vwhois/trunk/main/vgwhois vgwhois'
and to remove:
	update-inetd --pattern vgwhois --remove whois
